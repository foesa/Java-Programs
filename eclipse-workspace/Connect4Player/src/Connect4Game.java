Connect4Game class (35 marks)
My class creates references to the Connect 4 Grid and two Connect 4 Players. It asks the user whether he/she would like to play/quit inside a loop. If the user decides to play then: 1. Connect4Grid2DArray is created using the Connect4Grid interface, 2. the two players are initialised - must specify the type to be ConnectPlayer, and 3. the game starts. In the game, I ask the user where he/she would like to drop the piece. I perform checks by calling methods in the Connect4Grid interface. Finally a check is performed to determine a win.
